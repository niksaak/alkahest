//!
//! *Alkahest* is serialization library aimed for packet writing and reading in hot path.
//! For this purpose *Alkahest* avoids allocations and reads data only on demand.
//!
//! Key differences of *Alkahest* from other popular serialization crates is zero-overhead serialization and zero-copy lazy deserialization.\
//! For example to serialize value sequence it is not necessary to construct expensive type with allocations such as vectors.\
//! Instead sequences are serialized directly from iterators. On deserialization an iterator is returned to the user, which does not parse any element before it is requested.
//! Which means that data that is not accessed - not parsed either.
//!
//! *Alkahest* works similarly to *FlatBuffers*,\
//! but does not require using another language for data scheme definition and running external tool,\
//! and supports generic schemas.
